The whole point of me picking up Typescript is so that I can have working projects I can see asap.
Go is nice, but a little up there rn in terms of tech. Typescript is a lot lighter
but still provides me with the typed nature of languages which I love.

I hope that I can finish this Microsoft Learning training and get to building asap.
